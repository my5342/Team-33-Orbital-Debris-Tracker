1/26/2022, Grant Mays.
- Working on RF board layout changes for respin. 
- Moved to 4 layer design.
- added connectors.
- Selected new inductor for the duplexer with appropriate SRF.
- Intend to finish layout changes this week to send board out for fabrication.

- Troubleshooting with R01 Board:
  1. Identified error in VCO circuit which caused frequency instability: 
     ripple in vref due to no filtering. Will fix with bypass caps to GND.
  2. Trying to come up with method to test PA. Issues involved:
        a. need matched impedance interface w/ o'scope, can't get with simple jumper
           and o-scope probe. 
        b. 
- Layout Respin:
  1. Fixed MAX2750 footprint error in PCB library, re-added to layout.
  2. Added connector to board
  3. Re-routed power traces on LYR3 (PWR-GND) and signal traces as necessary on LYR 4 (SIG2).
  4. Added test point for freq-volt converter, broke out signal for interface w/ ADC.
  5. Cleaned up DRC errors. 
  6. Cleaned up some awkward placement of parts which proved troublesome last semester.

- Summary: 
  Layout respin completion: 80%. Est. Date of Completion: 2/4/2022
  Troubleshooting errors from R01 board: 40%. Est. Date of Completion: 2/3/2022

- Notes: 
  Limited success with troubleshooting the PA/LNA due to test interface. Need 
  some method of interfacing thru an SMA connector so that impedances are matched, 
  otherwise nothing is read at o'scope even though device is operational. 
  
  need to get access to a spectrum analyzer up to and beyond 2.5GHz.

1. Completed respin of rev 02 board, sending out for quote/purchase. 
   - had to design Wilkinson power divider as previous power divider was done incorrectly. 
   - designed, calculated, verified with simulations, performed layout, etc.
   - had to add gain stage to drive the LO pin of the mixer which downconverts the radar backscatter.
   - cleaned up errors from DRC.
   - Added bypass caps to vref to filter signal.
2. Completed as much troubleshooting as can be done with the rev 01 board.
3. made a testing plan to do some "pre-integration" between processing mod and 
   RF mod using the working parts of the R01 RF mod.

⁃ PCB ordered last week, worked out issues with supplier. Receive date is 2-18-2022.
⁃ To do: assemble Rev 02 board Friday/Saturday, integrate with processing module
Sunday/Monday if board is functioning.

Received Rev 2 board
Populated Rev 2, tested sig gen, freq-volt, verified working.
Shelved testing rest of board to help troubleshoot PSU.

Populated PA, mixer amp. PA does not seem to be working yet. Troubleshooting to no success. 

Continued helping Alex troubleshoot PSU and began integrating with working parts of my board.

Verified that Mingi's RPI can read output from RF mod.

Spent the blitz troubleshooting the PSU with Alex, got P28V, P3V3 and P5V working. 
Succesfully integrated P3V3 and P5V, however P28V isn't able to supply load. 
Reached out to Dr. Lusher for assistance. 

Mixer amp not working, the Vin pin is shorted to GND (desoldered from board and verified). 
Chip might be fried - will solder on spare, re-asses circuit for errors and retest.
